# S3DataPacker

This little tool aims to process a large amount of individual tiny files stored in some S3 bucket,
in order to combine them into larger batches that are more managable for a variety of purposes.

Combining these small raw files into bigger ones enables some optimizations if you re upload these
packed files to S3, like compressing these batches to save space, prepare data for other services
like AWS Athena, implement life cycle policies that didn't work on tiny files, and overall have
more managable items to work with for cataloguing, or other processes. Simply put, it will be easier
to download one big file at a time and process its contents than download millions of tiny files
for the same purpose.

The idea behind this tool was mainly a way to prepare and optimize data to better work with Athena
and keep costs of operation low.

For now, the tool just packs JSON files, splitted by CRLB characters, compressing the results with
GZip.
